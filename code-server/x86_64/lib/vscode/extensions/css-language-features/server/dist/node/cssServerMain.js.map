For scalable fonts, the font-size is a scale factor applied to the EM unit of the font. (Note that certain glyphs may bleed outside their EM box.) For non-scalable fonts, the font-size is converted into absolute units and matched against the declared font-size of the font, using the same absolute coordinate space for both of the matched values.\",\n            \"restrictions\": [\n                \"length\",\n                \"percentage\"\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"font-size-adjust\",\n            \"browsers\": [\n                \"FF3\",\n                \"Spreview\"\n            ],\n            \"values\": [\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"none\",\n                    \"description\": \"Do not preserve the font's x-height.\"\n                }\n            ],\n            \"syntax\": \"none | [ ex-height | cap-height | ch-width | ic-width | ic-height ]?
